# This is a comment
# Anything I write after the # symbol will not be run by the program.

All 4 sections are required and must be put within a multi line comment at the start of every assignment
'''

# Below is an output statement, also known as a print statement.  It outputs to the console what is inside the brackets
print(5) # This outputs the number 5















print()

#print statements go down a line after outputting what is in their brackets, kind of like hitting enter after you type something.
print(4.5) #This outputs the number 4.5


#Putting a bunch of lines between your code does not change your output.



# The following line does not work
#print(hello) 

# All text requires quotations marks to be recognized as text instead of code
#This does work becuase it has quotations around the text.
print ("hello there!! I'm so excited to be here.") 

# Summary
  
#**Comments**

#Use's # in python to make a comment
#Does not affect code.
#Can be used to omit lines of your code you don't want to run

#Note the section above.  This is how to start the documentation for your code.  It should include all the information above.
#Notice that instead of the # symbol it uses ''' to start the comments and ''' to end the comments.
#Anything between those quotes is not considered code and will not run just like comments.

# **Output**

# print() to output something.
# print() creates a new line character after it
# Adding spaces before, after, between code does not change it.  Only inside of ""
# Adding lines between print statements does not make their outputs farther apart.
